				Concept of Waterproofing
Waterproofing is the combination of materials of system that prevent the water intrusion into structural member of building as its finished of portion. The basic of waterproofing to prevent the structure from water/moisture and make it water tight. Water is very harmful to structure and it can give damages more than any natural disasters.

Recommendations:

<li>First understand the water source literally to be encountered.</li>
<li>Design system to prevent water leakages or sources.</li>
<li>Finalizing design to detailing each individual envelope component.</li>

Water Sources:
Generally water intrusion into any structure due to
<ol>
<li>Rain water for above ground waterproofing.</li>
<li>Below ground waterproofing water sources may be ground water and high hydrostatic pressure of water present in soil.</li>
</ol>

The availability of water into the structure is due to numerous sources that includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Natural gravity</li>
<li>Surface tension</li>
<li>Wind on air currants</li>
<li>Capillary action</li>
<li>Hydrostatic Pressure</li>
<li>Encounter to first problem eloping of roof shall &frac14; in/ft instead of that roof 80% of waterproofing problem may be reduce by dreaming away from structure.</li>
<li>Surface tension is the momentum that occurs when water is being moved by gravity approaches in change building plane. Example : Brick face to lintel. This problem occurs at mortar joints. To prevent this situation drip edges, flashing stop water intrusion.</li>
<li>If there is wind present in rain storm water is docilely affected by wind current. Flashing will prevent wind and water to penetrate inside the structure.</li>
<li>Capillary action occurs in a situation where water is absorbed into envelops substrate by wicking action. This situation is most likely to occurs with masonry on concrete portion of envelop on below ground levels. May be during construction it may have high voids, specs within composition.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>High hydrostatic pressure most commonly affects the below ground portion of the structure, it may depends on subject to waterproofing. This pressure can be significant, particularly below ground areas where the water table is near the surface or rises near the surfaces during the heavy rain falls. Water under this significant pressure will sealed out any jointures&rsquo; in the envelope especially the areas of weakness e.g. terminations and transition between the envelope component. That is why below grade system have to be better protected against water infiltration then those above grade. For example concrete above grade is only protection by water repellants, whereas below grade same concrete must be protected with a waterproofing material to prevent any leakages into the structure.</li>
</ol>


		Waterproofing in India
The concept of waterproofing started with building construction activities in India. People in the very primitive age were aware of waterproofing.
	Activities:
In India the Conventional Waterproofing methods were being used. Mudfuska &amp; clay were used in conventional waterproofing method. Bitumen uses of Waterproofing had a very long history.

Why Bitumen accepted:
Bitumen available in a cold state at room temperature on heating state bitumen becomes thin liquid which goes in pours and seals the substrate, which helps to stop the water seepage through substrate. Bitumen available in a cold state at room temperature, on heating state bitumen becomes thin liquid which goes in pours and seals the substrate which helps to stop the water seepage through substrate

Draw backs of Bitumen:
<ol>
<li>Low Softening Point of 50 to 60<sup>0</sup>C</li>
<li>Bitumen become soft in summer and it stats dripping through walls</li>
<li>Cold flexibility in bitumen is not there , it start crack during cold weather.</li>
</ol>
Hence there was the need of Bitumen with higher softening point which gives idea of Oxidizing Bitumen.

Oxidized Bitumen Felt:</strong></p>
<p>Oxidized bitumen was being used for waterproofing purpose and later on the concept of reinforcing the Bitumen was developed with different layers of Oxidized Bitumen. Hessian cloth for reinforcement was used.This system was named as Hot mop system and it has been defined as Built-up roofing system. Tarfelt was first time introduced in India in 1956 later on the reinforcement was replaced by glass fabric and this has given the new waterproofing system as&rdquo; Tarfelt&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>The various treatment of Tarfelt Mop-up roofing is given below;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Five course treatment.</li>
<li>Seven course treatment.</li>
<li>Nine course treatment.</li>
</ol>
Thickness of Tarfelt membrane 1.0 mm -1.5 mm. Oxidized Membrane thickness up to 5.0 mm. But still the problem of cold flexibility remain as it. Although there was a slight improvement but still membrane were tends to crack even a temperature of 10<sup>0</sup>C. Moreover the 100<sup>0</sup>C softening point was not enough during peck hour andsurface temperature go beyond 80<sup>0</sup>C. This results in soften, melting &amp; bleeding of oxidized membrane.</p>
As time passes various products and modern construction techniques are implemented.&nbsp; Some of common products are used for waterproofing are given below;

In 1943 the Danish chemist Lauritz Jensen patented the new crystalline active concrete waterproofing method. In 1946 he founded his first company and called it VANDEX (&bdquo;water out&ldquo;). Chemical reaction between hydration product of cement and crystalline active ingredients with resulting crystal formation in concrete. The crystalline system includes;</p>

<li><strong> Conventional WP System:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Lot of people even today use the conventional method of waterproofing. Few of them are common and being used in residential roofing, basements and wet areas. Brick bat Coba, Kota stone, acrylic polymeric cement slurry coating and grouting with non-shrink cement grout is common. However these system are depends on labour skills. These systems are not designed for the expansion contruction of building and very rigid in nature. Integral waterproofing compound used in cement mortar to fill the gaps.
